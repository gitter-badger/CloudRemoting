CloudRemoting module provides an easy and scriptable way to connect to EC2, Azure
or to other machines via RDP or PSRemoting sessions on top of the standard
cmdlets by:
 - Seamless EC2 Administrator Credential decryption for RDP and PSRemoting
 - Credential pass-through for RDP Sessions

## Installation
CloudRemoting is available via [PowerShellGallery][PowerShellGallery] and via
[PsGet][psget], so you can simply install it with the following command:
```powershell
# Install it from PowerShellGallery / PsGet repos
Install-Module CloudRemoting

# Or install it from this repository
Install-Module -ModuleUrl https://github.com/murati-hu/CloudRemoting/archive/latest.zip
```
Of course you can download and install the module manually too from
[Downloads][download]

## Usage
```powershell
Import-Module CloudRemoting
```

## Few Examples
### Enter an EC2 Admin RDP Session with Private-Key file
You can use the `Enter-EC2RdpSession` cmdlet or its `ec2rdp` alias to connect to any EC2 instance as an administrator via RDP.
```powershell
Get-Ec2Instance i-2492acfc | Enter-EC2RdpSession -PemFile '~/.ssh/myprivatekey.pem'
```

### Open EC2 Admin PSSessions with Private-Key
Similarly to the native `PSSession` cmdlets, you can use the `New-EC2PSSession` and `Enter-EC2RdpSession` commands to create or enter to any EC2 PSSession as an administrator:
```powershell
# Enter to a single EC2 PSSession
Get-Ec2Instance i-2492acfc | Enter-EC2PSSession -PemFile '~/.ssh/myprivatekey.pem'

# Create multiple EC2 PSSessions for further operations
Get-Ec2Instance -Filter @{name='tag:env'; value='demo'} | New-EC2PSSession -PemFile '~/.ssh/myprivatekey.pem'
```

Please note that all EC2 cmdlets rely on the official [`AWSPowershell`][AWSPowershell] module.
It expects the module to be installed with valid AWS credentials setup.


### RemoteDesktop to any machine
In order to connect to any machine via RDP, you can simply call `Enter-RdpSession` cmdlet or its `rdp` alias.
```powershell
# Connect an RDP Session to any machine
$c = Get-EC2Credential # Or retrieve from a persisted creds
Enter-RdpSession -ComputerName '207.47.222.251' -Credential $c
```
